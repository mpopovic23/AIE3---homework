        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

            "\n",
            "Agent Response: RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique used in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their performance by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. The core idea behind RAG is to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs by incorporating relevant information retrieved from a large corpus of documents or a knowledge base. This approach helps in generating more accurate and contextually relevant responses, especially for tasks that require specific knowledge or up-to-date information.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Components of RAG:\n",
            "1. **Retriever**: This component is responsible for fetching relevant documents or passages from a large corpus based on the input query.\n",
            "2. **Generator**: This component generates the final response by conditioning on both the input query and the retrieved documents.\n",
            "\n",
            "### How RAG Works:\n",
            "1. **Query Input**: The user provides a query or prompt.\n",
            "2. **Retrieval Step**: The retriever searches a large corpus to find documents or passages that are relevant to the query.\n",
            "3. **Generation Step**: The generator takes the original query and the retrieved documents as input to generate a coherent and contextually appropriate response.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Advantages of RAG:\n",
            "- **Improved Accuracy**: By leveraging external knowledge, RAG can provide more accurate and detailed responses.\n",
            "- **Contextual Relevance**: The retrieval step ensures that the generated content is relevant to the specific context of the query.\n",
            "- **Scalability**: RAG can be scaled to work with very large corpora, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n",

            "### When Did RAG Break Onto the Scene?\n",
            "RAG was introduced in a research paper by Facebook AI (now Meta AI) in 2020. The paper, titled \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks,\" was presented at the Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference in 2020. The introduction of RAG marked a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing, particularly for tasks that require access to a large amount of external knowledge.\n",

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how RAG works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: The model first retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This step ensures that the model has access to accurate and contextually relevant information.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from the retrieved documents is combined with the original query to provide a richer context for the generation step.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generation model (often a transformer-based model like GPT) uses the augmented input to generate a response. The generation model can produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses because it has access to the relevant information retrieved in the first step.\\n\\nRAG models are particularly useful in scenarios where the information required to generate a response is not contained within the model's parameters but can be found in external documents or databases. This approach helps in generating more informed and accurate responses, especially for complex queries that require specific knowledge.\""

Here are some significant improvements that the LoRA system makes:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for fine-tuning large models. Instead of updating all the parameters of the model, LoRA introduces low-rank matrices that adapt the pre-trained weights, making the process more efficient.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint during training. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models that would otherwise require substantial computational resources.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process becomes faster. This allows for quicker iterations and experimentation, which is valuable in research and development settings.\\n\\n4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The reduction in computational resources and time translates to lower costs for training models. This makes it more feasible for organizations with limited budgets to fine-tune large models.\\n\\n5. **Scalability**: LoRA makes it easier to scale the fine-tuning process to very large models, which would be impractical to fine-tune using traditional methods due to resource constraints.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility**: The low-rank adaptation approach can be applied to various parts of the model, providing flexibility in how the fine-tuning is performed. This allows for targeted adaptations that can improve performance on specific tasks.\\n\\n7. **Performance**: Despite the reduction in the number of trainable parameters, models fine-tuned with LoRA often achieve comparable or even superior performance to those fine-tuned with traditional methods. This is because LoRA effectively captures the essential adaptations needed for the target task.\\n\\nOverall, LoRA provides a more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable approach to fine-tuning large language models, making it a valuable technique in the field of machine learning.',\n",
